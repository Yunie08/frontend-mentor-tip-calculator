## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript


### Continued development

- __Improvement on this project:__
  - (very) large number inputs display is not yet optimized
  - refactorize some portions of javascript code (listening to two events, with the same consequences)

- __Continued development:__ This is one of my first projects using Javascript, therefore I still have a lot to learn : native javascript objects and methods, good coding practices with this specific language, etc.



### Useful resources

- [Styling radio buttons like buttons example](http://jsfiddle.net/YB8UW/8/) - This helped me with styling my radio buttons (for choosing tip) like actual buttons.
